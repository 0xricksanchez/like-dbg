# Contributing to LIKE-DBG

I'd love your input!
Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer


## Code of Conduct
I have adopted a Code of Conduct that I expect project participants to adhere to. 
Please [read the full text](https://github.com/0xricksanchez/like-dbg/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Discussions
If you're curious about a feature, the state of development, want to adapt this project for another use-case, or have anything else on your mind feel free to head over to the [discussions page](https://github.com/0xricksanchez/like-dbg/discussions).
This will be the best place to discuss topics in detail.

## Developing with Github

The typical [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) is employed here.
So, all code changes happen through pull requests.
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I'll actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. 
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/0xricksanchez/like-dbg/issues)
GitHub issues is used to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/0xricksanchez/like-dbg/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

This project employs several linters to ensure a consistent coding style:

 - [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
 - [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/)
